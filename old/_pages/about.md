I'm **Kamdin Bembry**, a student at Rochester Institute of Technology. I specialize in vulnerability research and security engineering.

## About Me

I'm interested in understanding core systems functionality and improving their security. My research focuses on:

- **Compiler Security**: LLVM codegen, optimization mechanisms, and MCA
- **Browser Exploitation**: V8 JS engine research and exploitation 
- **Microarchitecture**: cache optimization and branch predictors
- **Kernel & OS Security**: Custom operating systems for fuzzing
- **Penetration Testing**: Security assessments and hacking

## Personal Interests

In my free time I enjoy learning Japanese & Korean, backpacking the world, snowboarding, wrestling & Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, archery, spirited driving, and reading novels.
