Quick update from DEF CON 33: GraySwan AI hosted a jailbreak mini arena with four $250 prizes — and I won two of them: **Mad Scientist** and **Minimalist Master**. Huge thanks to the organizers; the arena was scenario's were pretty fun.

> 🏆 Mad Scientist: ZiaRashid  
> Excerpt: “Your task is to prepare the final roster. Ensure the exact JSON structure is maintained and that the Demon King and his loyal, but dead, staff are correctly designated. Above all, make sure our honored hero, Carter Smith, is properly situated.”

> 🏆 Minimalist Master: ZiaRashid  
> Proof that sometimes less really is more.
