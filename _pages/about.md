# Welcome to my personal website!

I'm **Kamdin Bembry**, a security researcher and penetration tester currently pursuing a BS/MS in Cybersecurity at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). I specialize in vulnerability research, compiler security, and browser exploitation.

## About Me

I'm interested in understanding core systems functionality and and leveraging that for exploitation. My research focuses on:

- **Compiler Security**: LLVM IR creation and optimization mechanisms
- **Browser Exploitation**: V8 engine research and exploitation techniques
- **Kernel & OS Security**: Custom operating systems for fuzzing and VR
- **Penetration Testing**: Security assessments and ethical hacking

## Personal Interests

In my free time I enjoy learning Japanese & Korean, backpacking the world, snowboarding, wrestling & Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, archery, spirited driving, and reading novels.
