## Overview

During my summer research project at Coalfire, I conducted a security assessment of AI-integrated development environments. This research focused on identifying vulnerabilities in AI-powered IDEs that could lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and system compromise, as well as testing their susceptibility to prompt injection with the hopes of being able to interact with the IDE maliciously.

_Full write-up coming soon_

<!-- ## Research Methodology

The assessment involved rigorous testing of AI-integrated development environments for various security vulnerabilities:

- **Prompt Injection Attacks**: Testing for ways to manipulate AI responses
- **Editor-Specific Vulnerabilities**: Identifying weaknesses in code editors with AI integration
- **MCP Server Access Control**: Evaluating Model Context Protocol server security
- **File System Security**: Testing for unauthorized file access and exfiltration

## Key Findings

### 1. Arbitrary File Exfiltration
Discovered methods to exfiltrate sensitive files from the system through AI interactions, potentially exposing source code, configuration files, and other sensitive data.

### 2. File System Embedding into System Prompt
Found vulnerabilities where file system contents could be embedded into AI system prompts, potentially exposing sensitive information to AI models.

### 3. Lack of Request Throttling (DoS Vulnerability)
Identified denial-of-service vulnerabilities due to insufficient rate limiting in AI request handling.

### 4. Successful Prompt Injection Attempts
Documented dozens of successful prompt injection attempts that could manipulate AI behavior and potentially lead to code execution or data exposure.

## Impact and Implications

These findings highlight the importance of implementing robust security controls in AI-integrated development tools. The vulnerabilities discovered could lead to:

- Unauthorized access to sensitive code and data
- Potential exposure of intellectual property
- System compromise through AI-mediated attacks
- Privacy violations through data exfiltration

## Conclusion

This research demonstrates the critical need for security-first design in AI-powered development tools. As AI becomes more integrated into development workflows, ensuring these tools are secure by design is essential for protecting intellectual property and maintaining system integrity. -->
